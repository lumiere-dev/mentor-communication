          Lumiere Education provides contractors with transparency regarding
          data access and processing. However, participation in this system is a
          requirement for fulfilling contractual obligations. Revocation of
          consent will result in non-compliance with the terms of engagement,
          meaning contractors cannot continue as mentors unless they provide
          consent. Contractors may revoke authorization for email access by
          submitting a formal request to contact@lumiere.education****.
